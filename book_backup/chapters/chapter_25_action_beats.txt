ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: Leo steps through the shimmering Gate. It vanishes behind him, leaving him standing on the same gray, rain-dampened street where his journey began.
- Beat 2: He looks around. The world is identical—the same bleak buildings, the same oppressive, melancholic atmosphere—but he is fundamentally, irrevocably changed.
- Beat 3: The crushing weight of apathy and despair that once defined him is gone, replaced by a quiet, mature resolve.
- Beat 4: He sees the landmarks of his old life: the soul-crushing carpet warehouse, the gutter where he found the coin. They are no longer sources of pain, but milestones on his path.
- Beat 5: Leo understands that his old world is no longer a prison he must endure. He sees it now as something new: a training ground.
- Beat 6: He realizes his new purpose is not to escape this world, but to use it as a place to focus, to grow, and to nurture the gift Tia gave him.
- Beat 7: Stopping in the middle of the sidewalk, Leo closes his eyes, shutting out the visual grayness and turning his senses inward.
- Beat 8: He searches for the feeling Tia described, reaching into the silence that was once his defining feature.
- Beat 9: After a moment of concentration, he finds it: a tiny, warm, and persistent ember glowing deep within his chest.
- Beat 10: For the first time, he consciously feels the spark of Resonance inside him—a tangible, living piece of Elysia he now carries.
- Beat 11: A small, genuine smile touches Leo's lips. He understands with absolute clarity that his journey is not over; a new one has just begun.
- Beat 12: The chapter—and the story—concludes on a forward-looking, hopeful thought as Leo looks down at his hands, no longer empty, and accepts his new life's mission: He has a door to build.
