ACTION\_BEATS:

-   Beat 1: A group of four survivors—the pragmatic warrior Arana, the empathetic healer Miel, the silent scout Kaa, and the mystic guide Sileus—travel cautiously through an ancient, vibrant forest in northern Elysia.
-   Beat 2: As they near the River Qi, Sileus suddenly stumbles, overwhelmed by a violent, three-part disturbance he feels in the Weave.
-   Beat 3: Sileus explains to the others what he felt: a sickening ripple of Dissonance and a powerful, pure wave of Resonance. But he also describes a third sensation—a weak, strange anomaly unlike anything he's ever felt, a quiet disruption in the Weave's rhythm that he can't quite identify.
-   Beat 4: Arana expresses immediate skepticism, arguing that pursuing Sileus's mystical feelings is a dangerous detour from their practical goal of reaching the fortified city of Eleium.
-   Beat 5: Sileus insists with uncharacteristic urgency, convincing the reluctant group that this convergence of forces is a pivotal event for Elysia and that they must investigate what is happening downstream.
-   Beat 6: Miel, feeling the purity of the Resonance ripple, supports Sileus, while Kaa gives a single, pragmatic nod, agreeing that something so unusual must be investigated.
-   Beat 7: With Arana reluctantly agreeing, the group changes course, leaving the path to Eleium to follow the powerful River Qi downstream, moving with caution.
-   Beat 8: They travel for hours, following the river's path as the sun begins to set, moving as a single, alert unit.
-   Beat 9: Kaa, scouting ahead of the group, suddenly freezes at the edge of a bluff overlooking the river.
-   Beat 10: Kaa silently raises a single hand, signaling for the others to halt and join him.
-   Beat 11: Sileus, Arana, and Miel gather beside Kaa, who points with a slow, deliberate gesture toward a bend in the river.
-   Beat 12: On a small, gravelly sandbank on the opposite shore, the group spots two dark figures washed ashore, lying motionless at the water's edge.
