ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: As the four survivors make their final, grim preparations for the journey south, Sileus gathers them, his expression so grave it halts all activity.
- Beat 2: Sileus begins by confessing he was not entirely truthful in the Weaver's Paths. He admits he found more than just a simple carving, and that the truth was so terrifying he kept it a secret to protect them.
- Beat 3: He describes the hidden chamber in detail, focusing on the central image: two massive serpents chasing each other in a perfect, closed temporal loop.
- Beat 4: Sileus then reveals the full, reality-bending truth. At the heart of the ancient carving was the unmistakable image of Leo's coin, proving that the coin is not a simple artifact but a paradox from the future, caught in an endless cycle.
- Beat 5: The group is stunned into silence. Leo clutches the coin, its simple weight now feeling impossibly heavy. Tia looks horrified, understanding the implications of a "closed loop" on a personal, terrifying level.
- Beat 6: Sileus explains that this paradox, this impossible nature of the coin, is the very thing that makes it their only weapon. To defeat an entity that wants to unmake reality, they must use a weapon that breaks reality's rules.
- Beat 7: He then explains the terrifying gamble they must take. He tells Tia that she must *deliberately* trigger the very cataclysm they've been fearing, a process he calls "Annihilation by Totality," by willingly connecting with the coin's paradoxical nature.
- Beat 8: Miel lets out a horrified gasp, understanding that Sileus is asking Tia to commit a form of spiritual suicide.
- Beat 9: Before anyone can protest, Sileus turns to Leo. He explains that Leo's unique nature as an outsider—a being with no connection to the Weave—makes him the group's only defense. He is a "Temporal Anchor."
- Beat 10: Sileus clarifies Leo's role: as Tia's consciousness is shredded and scattered across her timeline by the paradox, Leo must hold on to her, his non-magical, linear sense of "now" acting as the only stable point she can re-form around.
- Beat 11: Sileus concludes by stating that this is their only plan. It is a desperate, near-suicidal leap of faith, trusting that Leo's nature as an anchor is strong enough to save Tia from complete annihilation.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends on the heavy, dreadful silence of the survivors as they absorb the insane, terrifying plan. The immense uncertainty and the weight of their near-suicidal gamble hangs between them.
