CHARACTER_PROFILES:

LEO:
- Role: Main Character, Reluctant Hero, The Temporal Anchor
- Physical Description: Early 20s (approx. 23-24). Normal, slightly lanky build from manual labor. His posture is often slightly stooped, as if carrying the invisible weight of disappointment. A few days' stubble suggests he's given up a bit. Dark brown hair, unkempt. Brown eyes that often look empty but can glimmer with fear or a rare spark of determination. Wears a cheap, dark grey zippered hoodie, worn denim jeans, and practical but worn sneakers or work boots, all quickly becoming muddy and travel-worn. He always carries a simple, old, faded coin in his pocket—etched with the faint image of two serpents chasing each other's tails—and often fiddles with it.
- Background: Comes from our "normal" world, where he worked at a carpet warehouse and was reeling from a humiliating breakup with his ex, Cecilia, who left him for his boss. This life of mundane failure and purposelessness makes him an anomaly in the destined world of Elysia. He is an outsider whose very nature—grounded in a non-magical, linear reality—is foreign to the Weave. The ancient coin he finds is the catalyst for his journey and the physical manifestation of a temporal paradox he is unknowingly part of.
- Personality: Initially apathetic, cynical, and easily overwhelmed. His logical mind struggles to process the irrationality of Elysia. Beneath the surface, however, is a fundamental decency and a nascent courage that emerges when others are in danger. His journey is a constant battle against his own despair and impulse to retreat. He is observant but often tries to deny what he sees, especially the strange temporal flickers that surround him and Tia.
- Goals/Motivations: Initially, his only goal is survival and a desperate desire to return to the mundane safety of his own world. This shifts to protecting his new companions, particularly Tia. His ultimate motivation becomes embracing his outsider status not as a weakness, but as the one unpredictable "variable" that can save his friends when all of Elysia's power and magic fails.

TIA:
- Role: Main Character, The Chosen One, Bearer of Aegion's Blood, The Paradox's Nexus
- Physical Description: Late teens (approx. 18-19). Slender and sinewy, with an agile strength built for endurance. Her face is striking, marked by both hardship and a deep-seated determination. Long, dark, thick hair, often in a loose, practical braid. Her most prominent feature is her intense green eyes, which seem to glow faintly when she focuses her will. Wears a worn tunic of faded violet, durable trousers, and sturdy leather boots. Carries two short swords on her back, their hilts worn smooth from use.
- Background: The last known living member of her bloodline, her family lost to the spreading Rot. This loss has instilled in her a fierce determination to fight back. She is unaware that she is the Bearer of Aegion's Blood, a power that makes her personal timeline deeply and dangerously connected to the Weave. This connection makes her the focal point for the temporal instability of the paradoxical coin Leo carries.
- Personality: Resilient, determined, and burdened by a sense of responsibility. Despite her outward strength, she is vulnerable to the strange, confusing temporal visions and moments of vertigo that plague her when near Leo and the coin. She is pragmatic but, unlike Arana, is willing to believe in the hope Sileus offers. She is fiercely protective, forming a quick, deep bond with Leo.
- Goals/Motivations: To fight the Rot and prevent others from suffering the same losses she has. As she learns of her heritage as the Bearer of Aegion's Blood, her goal becomes understanding and controlling her power. Ultimately, she must confront the terrifying reality that her connection to the coin could erase her from existence, forcing her to make a choice of ultimate sacrifice.

ARANA:
- Role: Supporting Character, The Pragmatist, The Protector
- Physical Description: Early 20s (approx. 22-23). Thin and sinewy, almost hard, built for speed and agility. Her posture is always vigilant. A hard, angular face with sharp, observant dark brown eyes that see and analyze everything. Dark blonde hair is often pulled tightly back. Wears practical layered clothing in earthy colors and carries a bow and quiver, always ready.
- Background: Hardened by a life on the edge of the Rot, having lost her own family. She has learned to survive by her wits and strength, making her wary of outsiders and dismissive of "myths and legends." Her belief system is rooted in tangible threats and practical solutions, making her skeptical of Sileus's mystical guidance.
- Personality: Tough, cynical, and fiercely protective of her chosen companions. She is the most pragmatic member of the group, always assessing threats and advocating for the most direct, logical course of action for survival. Her arguments against Sileus's more dangerous plans seem entirely reasonable and born of a desire to keep the group safe, making her a trusted, if stern, voice of caution.
- Goals/Motivations: To keep her companions safe by any means necessary. She is driven by a need for security and control over their immediate circumstances, believing that focusing on daily survival is more important than chasing "grand destinies."

MIEL:
- Role: Supporting Character, The Healer, The Empathic Heart
- Physical Description: Late teens (approx. 16-17). More delicate in appearance than Arana, her movements quiet and almost ghostly. A softer, rounder face, often marked by anxiety. Her light brown eyes are large and expressive, revealing her fear and sorrow, but also a rare warmth. She carries a leather bag with gathered herbs.
- Background: Orphaned by the Rot, she found a new family in Arana and Tia. She has a natural, empathetic connection to the flora of Elysia and can sense the "sickness" in the land. This makes her sensitive to the Weave's corruption and subtly attuned to the goodness of Resonance.
- Personality: Sensitive, empathetic, and easily overwhelmed. She is often anxious but possesses a quiet strength and deep compassion. She is the first to offer comfort and the one who often provides the group's moral compass. It is her insight into Leo's nature as an unpredictable "variable" that gives him the final piece of hope he needs.
- Goals/Motivations: To find safety and peace for her found family. She is driven by a desire to heal and avoid suffering. She acts as the emotional glue of the group, her quiet observations often proving more insightful than anyone expects.

KAA:
- Role: Supporting Character, The Silent Scout
- Physical Description: Late teens or very early 20s (approx. 19-20). A lean, muscular climber's body. Moves with restless, almost superhuman agility. His angular face is often unreadable. His most striking feature is a thick mane of almost white hair, contrasting with his dark, practical clothing. His light, ice-grey eyes are constantly scanning. Carries several hidden knives.
- Background: Having spent much of his life surviving in the corrupted lands, he has a primal understanding of its dangers. He is uniquely unaffected by the paranoia-inducing "Metallic Blight," suggesting a subtle resistance or deep adaptation to the Rot's influence.
- Personality: Enigmatic, quiet, and hyper-focused. He operates on instinct and observation, his loyalty shown through actions, not words. He is fiercely independent but a reliable member of the company, often appearing at the last second to save someone from a threat he spotted moments before anyone else.
- Goals/Motivations: Primarily survival. He is drawn to the group as the best means of navigating the increasing chaos. He may have a silent, unspoken desire to see the world healed, as he knows the pain of the corrupted lands better than anyone.

SILEUS:
- Role: Supporting Character, Mentor, The Burdened Scholar
- Physical Description: Appears to be in his 40s, lanky but tough. His face is weathered, with sharp, intelligent features and keen, bird-like eyes. His defining garment is a two-sided cloak: one side a vibrant, chaotic patchwork of colors; the other muted earth tones for camouflage. He carries a twisted walking stick more for gesturing than support.
- Background: A solitary wanderer who has dedicated his life to studying the Weave and its forgotten history. He has been waiting for a catalyst to set events in motion. His knowledge of ancient lore is unparalleled, but even he is terrified when he discovers the Ouroboros carving and realizes the true, paradoxical nature of the coin, a truth he withholds until the last possible moment.
- Personality: Eccentric, wise, and highly perceptive. He often speaks in riddles but his guidance is invaluable. He is patient but becomes driven by a new urgency after discovering the secret of the coin. He carries the heavy burden of knowing that the group's only hope is also a temporal bomb that could destroy Tia.
- Goals/Motivations: To restore balance to Elysia. After discovering the paradox, his goal shifts to desperately trying to understand and manage it, guiding the group toward a confrontation where this terrifying power might be their only, and most costly, option.

ASAKAEL:
- Role: Main Antagonist, Cosmic Force of Corruption
- Physical Description: Most often manifests as a concentration of pure shadow with two malevolent, burning orange embers for eyes. His voice is a dry, rasping sound that echoes directly in the mind. His presence exudes a profound cold and Dissonance that causes physical and mental distress.
- Background: An ancient, primordial force of entropy whose purpose is to unmake creation by tearing The Weave apart. He has recently reawakened from a millennial sleep and is spreading his influence from the Southern Valleys northward.
- Personality: Utterly malevolent, but also highly intelligent, patient, and strategic. He is a master of manipulation and delights in despair. He becomes academically fascinated by the coin's paradox, viewing it as an unforeseen "variable" and a beautiful, ironic instrument for Tia's eventual self-destruction.
- Goals/Motivations: To manipulate Tia into using her power to open the "Gates," allowing him to completely destroy The Weave. He is confident in his victory and views the heroes' struggle with amused, detached curiosity.

ROTSPAWN:
- Role: Minions, Cannon Fodder
- Physical Description: Hideously warped versions of native fauna (deer, insects, etc.). Green-brown skin stretched over disjointed skeletons, with crooked arms, blackened claws, and mouths full of uneven teeth dripping black ichor. Their eyes glow with a dull, malevolent light devoid of true intelligence. They move with a jerky, unnatural gait.
- Background: Living extensions of Asakael's corrupting influence, created from the animals of the blighted lands. They are physical manifestations of Dissonance.
- Personality: Operating on cruel, base instincts. They are driven by a simple mandate to cause pain and serve their master. They possess a low, cunning instinct for hunting but are cowardly when faced with overwhelming force.
- Goals/Motivations: To serve Asakael's immediate will: capture Tia, harass the heroes, and guard corrupted areas.

DARK WOLF:
- Role: Elite Hunter, Corrupted Predator
- Physical Description: A larger, more intelligent version of a corrupted wolf. Its fur is the color of charcoal and shadow, and its eyes glow with a malevolent, cunning intelligence, unlike the dull light of the Rotspawn. Its movements are fluid and predatory, not jerky. Its claws and teeth are unnaturally long and stained with the black ichor of the Rot, and its howl is a Dissonant sound that causes fear and disorientation.
- Background: Where Rotspawn are twisted fauna, Dark Wolves are apex predators that have not just been corrupted by the Rot, but have *embraced* it, forming a symbiotic bond with the Dissonance. They retain their hunting instincts and intelligence, which are then amplified by Asakael's influence, making them far more dangerous than a standard Rotspawn.
- Personality: Cunning, patient, and viciously intelligent. A Dark Wolf will stalk its prey, learn its weaknesses, and strike with tactical precision. It is not just a monster; it is a sentient hunter fueled by malice. It is capable of inspiring terror and is a significant threat to even a prepared group.
- Goals/Motivations: To hunt and kill for its master, Asakael. They often act as alpha predators among lesser Rotspawn, sometimes leading them in coordinated attacks. Their primary motivation is the thrill of a successful hunt and the spreading of fear.

ROT-KNIGHT:
- Role: Elite Minion, Commander of the Rot
- Physical Description: A tall, humanoid figure clad in jagged, overlapping plates of armor that seem to be forged from solidified shadow and nightmare. The armor is a black, corroded mockery of noble plate, its surface crawling with faint, pulsing runes of Dissonance that glow with a sickening, internal light, like dying embers. Barbs of obsidian-like material jut out at sharp, unnatural angles. It wields a massive, chipped greatsword, so black it seems to absorb the light around it, its edge weeping a black, viscous substance that sizzles as it drips to the ground. Its movements are heavy and implacable, yet possess a terrifying, unnatural swiftness. Its face is hidden behind a featureless, sealed helm, but where the eye slits should be, there is only a void—an absolute, dizzying emptiness that promises utter annihilation.
- Background: The origin of the Rot-Knights is a dark mystery. Some believe they are the animated husks of the greatest warriors who fell fighting Asakael, their armor and will now enslaved, their souls devoured and replaced by the void they now show the world. Others whisper they are constructs of pure Dissonance given form and purpose by their master, walking extensions of his empty, all-consuming will. They serve as Asakael's lieutenants in the field.
- Personality: Cold, utterly silent, and implacably single-minded. A Rot-Knight exhibits a chilling tactical intelligence, able to command packs of lesser Rotspawn, exploit terrain, and target the hope and leadership within a group with terrifying precision. It does not feel pain or fear, only the cold, empty imperative of its master's will. It is a relentless, intelligent killing machine, a soulless dreadnought on the battlefield.
- Goals/Motivations: To execute Asakael's strategic commands with brutal efficiency. They act as field commanders, siege-breakers, and hunters of high-value targets. They are the physical extension of Asakael's strategic mind, their presence on the battlefield a guarantee of a coordinated, intelligent, and utterly merciless assault.
