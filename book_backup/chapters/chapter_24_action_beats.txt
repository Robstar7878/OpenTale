ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: In the silent aftermath of Asakael's defeat, the immense wave of released energy has nowhere to go. It funnels directly into the Temporal Anchor coin that Leo is still clutching.
- Beat 2: The coin in Leo's hand begins to glow with an impossibly bright, white-hot light, vibrating so violently he can barely hold onto it.
- Beat 3: The overloaded coin vanishes from Leo's hand in a final, silent flash, propelled back through time and space to land in a gutter in his world, perfectly completing the temporal paradox.
- Beat 4: The scene shifts forward several months. Elysia is healing. The Southern Valleys are slowly returning to life under a clear, blue sky.
- Beat 5: A fully healed Tia, now in confident control of her powers, stands with Leo before a shimmering, unstable Gateâ€”a portal she has managed to open back to his world.
- Beat 6: The mood is bittersweet and poignant. The time has come for Leo to leave Elysia and for them to say their farewells.
- Beat 7: Tia reaches out and takes Leo's hand, a quiet echo of the first time he grabbed hers on the collapsing riverbank.
- Beat 8: As their hands touch, a look of genuine, profound surprise crosses Tia's face as she senses something completely unexpected within him.
- Beat 9: Tia explains her surprise, her voice filled with awe. She tells Leo that when he first arrived, he was a complete "silence in the Weave," a void of non-magic. But now, that has changed.
- Beat 10: She reveals the consequence of his actions: "By anchoring me, you anchored a piece of Elysia inside yourself."
- Beat 11: She meets his hopeful, questioning gaze and clarifies that the spark of Resonance within him isn't strong enough to open a path back on its own. "Not yet," she says, her tone full of meaning.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends on a note of concrete hope as Tia gives him his new purpose: "But a spark can be fanned into a flame. This is your path now, if you choose it."
