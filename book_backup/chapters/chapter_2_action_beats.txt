ACTION\_BEATS:

-   Beat 1: Before Leo's arrival in Elysia, in a chamber of living darkness, Asakael confronts a kneeling, damaged Rot-Knight that has failed in its mission to capture Tia.
-   Beat 2: Asakael circles the failed servant, his voice a vibration in the mind, explaining that its failure represents an inefficiency in his grand design that must be corrected.
-   Beat 3: Asakael extends a hand, sending thin, black threads of pure Dissonance into the Rot-Knight. The threads inflict not physical pain, but a torturous existential agony, the feeling of being logically erased from reality as its artificial life-force is unmade.
-   Beat 4: After a prolonged, silent torment where the Knight's armor glows with agonizing energy before dying, the creature convulses one last time and its entire form crumbles into fine, black dust, which is absorbed back into the chamber's oppressive darkness.
-   Beat 5: Returning to his throne, Asakael decides that direct force is failing. He conceives of a new, long-term strategy: to infiltrate Tia's inevitable group of allies and turn her trust into a weapon against her.
-   Beat 6: Asakael summons his agent. A cloaked, shadowed figure, The Traitor, materializes from the darkness, standing silently and motionlessly before the throne.
-   Beat 7: Asakael outlines the insidious mission: The Traitor must join Tia's group, become their most staunch protector and trusted ally, and secretly guide them toward their ultimate ruin.
-   Beat 8: When The Traitor shows a minuscule, almost imperceptible shake of the head in defiance, Asakael reminds them of the price of disobedience.
-   Beat 9: Asakael conjures a silent, shimmering vision in the air. The vision shows a person, their specific identity kept from the reader but clearly someone cherished by The Traitor, living peacefully and completely unaware that they are being watched.
-   Beat 10: Asakael whispers a threat, detailing the unending agony he *will* inflict upon the person in the vision if The Traitor falters, promising to keep them on the edge of death for centuries. The contrast between the peaceful image and the horrific verbal threat shatters The Traitor's composure, and they recoil with a choked sound of utter despair.
-   Beat 11: The Traitor's body trembles uncontrollably. They lower their head and give a single, stiff nod of total and final capitulation, accepting the horrific assignment.
-   Beat 12: Asakael dismisses his agent, and The Traitor dissolves back into the shadows. Asakael leans back on his throne, savoring the cruel perfection of his new plan to corrupt hope from the inside out.
