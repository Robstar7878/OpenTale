ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: Following Sileus's guidance, the group navigates the skeletal ruins of Ull and locates the hidden entrance to a vast, subterranean vault.
- Beat 2: Sileus explains the location's significance: it's a failing Weave node, a place of immense but unstable power, making it the perfect—and most dangerous—place to probe the coin's true nature.
- Beat 3: Immediately taking tactical command, Arana scouts the chamber. Her expert eye dismisses the magic and focuses on defense, identifying chokepoints for a potential ambush.
- Beat 4: Arana's survey zeroes in on a single, massive obsidian pillar supporting the ceiling. She points out a deep, milky-white fracture running through its core, identifying it as a critical structural weak point.
- Beat 5: She presents the flawed pillar to the group as the most vulnerable and therefore most dangerous defensive position they must protect.
- Beat 6: With firm resolve, Arana declares, "I will hold that position myself. It's the most dangerous post, so it falls to me."
- Beat 7: Miel, Leo, and Tia look at Arana with admiration and concern, interpreting her declaration as yet another act of selfless, pragmatic courage. They fully agree to her tactical plan.
- Beat 8: With the group set in their defensive positions around the chamber, Sileus moves to the center and places Leo's coin on a flat, altar-like stone to begin his ritual.
- Beat 9: Sileus starts chanting in a low, ancient tongue. A low humming sound begins to fill the vault as the air crackles with energy drawn from both the coin and the failing Weave node.
- Beat 10: The humming intensifies, causing the very stones of the vault to vibrate. The group stands ready at their posts, weapons drawn, their faces taut with anticipation.
- Beat 11: The ritual reaches a critical point, the energy in the room becoming a palpable, oppressive force that promises an imminent, violent reaction.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends on a cliffhanger of absolute suspense as the group waits in the charged, humming silence for the inevitable enemy ambush to be sprung upon them.
