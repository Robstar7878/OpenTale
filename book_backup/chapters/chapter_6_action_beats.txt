ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: The forest falls silent before a massive, corrupted Dark Wolf, its eyes glowing with malevolent intelligence, bursts from the shadows, its guttural snarl shattering the quiet.
- Beat 2: Ignoring the others, the Dark Wolf focuses its intelligent, hateful gaze solely on Tia and lunges, confirming the group's fears that she is the primary target.
- Beat 3: Tia blocks the initial attack, but the wolf's brute force knocks her swords aside, leaving her vulnerable. Arana's perfectly aimed arrow is dodged with unnatural speed, and the wolf prepares a killing blow.
- Beat 4: Acting on pure, selfless instinct, Leo lunges forward. He shoves a stunned Arana out of his path and throws himself in front of Tia, taking the Dark Wolf's attack himself.
- Beat 5: The Dark Wolf's jaws clamp down on Leo's thigh, tearing through muscle with searing pain. Leo screams as the wolf's weight pins him to the forest floor, its corrupted breath in his face.
- Beat 6: Leo's sacrifice buys the necessary second. Kaa materializes and severs a tendon in the wolf's leg, while Sileus strikes its head with his staff, disorienting the beast.
- Beat 7: With the Dark Wolf staggered, Tia recovers and unleashes a furious, precise assault, ending the creature's life with a fatal thrust of her twin swords.
- Beat 8: As the others secure the area, Miel rushes to Leo's side, her face pale but her actions decisive. She applies pressure to the deep, corrupted gash, directing the panicked Tia to help.
- Beat 9: In a sheltered hiding spot, Miel performs specialized healing. She applies a poultice of **Kingsroot** to draw out the corruption—seen as a thin black smoke—and then covers the wound with a glowing **Silverleaf** to seal it and promote pure healing.
- Beat 10: Watching the healing, Arana gives Leo a single, grudging nod. The gesture is not one of gratitude, but a hard-won, pragmatic acknowledgement that his foolish, selfless act produced a successful result.
- Beat 11: In the days that follow, as Leo slowly recovers while the group traverses a harsh, dry plain, Sileus uses the opportunity to teach Leo and Tia about the Weave, explaining the difference between the life-force of Resonance and the corrupting sickness of Dissonance.
- Beat 12: Finally, after their arduous journey, the company reaches the foothills of the mountains. In the distance, Sileus points out their destination: the mountain city of Eleium, a sprawling fortress of stone and a beacon of hope.
