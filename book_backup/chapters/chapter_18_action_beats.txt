ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: In the immediate aftermath of the pillar's explosion, the shockwave of imploding energy rips through the vault. The temporal feedback incapacitates Tia instantly, while Sileus is thrown by the blast and grievously wounded by shrapnel.
- Beat 2: Miel, positioned in the supposedly "safe" zone Arana had designated, is caught directly in a volley of razor-sharp obsidian glass, and her piercing cry of agony cuts through the chaos.
- Beat 3: The sound of Miel's pain is the only thing Arana can hear. The abstract rationale for her betrayal shatters, replaced by the single, horrifying, all-consuming fact: she did this to her sister.
- Beat 4: Through the settling dust, the leader of the Rot-Knight ambush rises, wounded but still standing. It looms over the defenseless Miel, raising its weapon for the final blow.
- Beat 5: Seeing the imminent threat to her sister, Arana, her face streaked with tears and her rationale shattered by guilt, charges blindly through the dust.
- Beat 6: Arana throws her body in the way of the Rot-Knight's final, devastating attack, taking the full force of the blow meant for Miel.
- Beat 7: Mortally wounded, Arana collapses at Miel's side, locking eyes with her horrified sister, who can only stare in disbelief.
- Beat 8: Using her final, ragged breaths, Arana begins to reveal the secret that destroyed her, gasping, "Our brother… he's not dead, Miel."
- Beat 9: Arana's voice breaks with pain and guilt as she continues, explaining her desperate gamble: "Asakael has him… I thought… I thought I could save you both…"
- Beat 10: With her last ounce of strength, Arana delivers her final, heartbreaking admission: "...but I failed." Her body goes limp in her sister's arms.
- Beat 11: In the desolate ruin, as Miel cradles her dead sister's body, the disembodied, cruel voice of Asakael echoes through the chamber, mocking their tragedy and reveling in their pain.
- Beat 12: The chapter concludes on the tableau of the broken survivors—Leo wounded and watching in horror, Sileus unconscious, Tia unresponsive, and Miel sobbing over Arana's body—lost and trapped in the heart of Asakael's corrupted domain.
