ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: The company steps into the Weeping Swamp. The temperature plummets, and a thick, cold, and insidious mist immediately envelops them, muffling sound and filling the air with the oppressive smell of decay.
- Beat 2: The journey is immediately treacherous. Leo misjudges a step and his leg is swallowed by sucking, black mud, requiring Kaa's quick, silent intervention to pull him free before he's pulled under.
- Beat 3: As they venture deeper, the environment becomes a showcase of corruption. They pass skeletal, leafless trees weeping sickly, gray moss and navigate by the faint, unsettling glow of phosphorescent fungi.
- Beat 4: Miel, deeply sensitive to the Weave, grows physically ill, her empathy turning the swamp's sickness into a constant, nauseating headache for her.
- Beat 5: They pass the half-submerged, skeletal remains of a massive beast, its bones blackened and twisted into an unnatural shape, a clear and grim testament to the Rot's power.
- Beat 6: Arana's pragmatic leadership keeps the group focused. She enforces strict discipline, rationing their meager supplies and forcing them to maintain a defensive watch, even when they feel they are alone.
- Beat 7: The psychological toll of the oppressive, hopeless atmosphere becomes evident. The group travels in tense silence, their nerves frayed by the constant cold and insidious dread.
- Beat 8: Sileus observes that the Weave here isn't just weak; it's actively malevolent, a constant, low-frequency hum of Dissonance that grates on their senses.
- Beat 9: After what feels like an eternity of slogging through the mire, Kaa, scouting ahead, raises a hand, signaling a halt.
- Beat 10: Through a temporary break in the oppressive mist, the group sees the first sign of their destination: the fire-blackened, skeletal silhouette of a ruined watchtower in the distance.
- Beat 11: With renewed, grim purpose, they press on, the ground becoming more solid but also more desolate, littered with the debris of a forgotten battle.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends as the company stands at the edge of the sunken city of Ull. They are met with the overwhelming stench of old fire and rot, looking upon the skeletal ruins of a city that was not just destroyed, but murdered.
