ACTION_BEATS:

-   Beat 1: A group of four survivors—the pragmatic warrior Arana, the empathetic healer Miel, the silent scout Kaa, and the mystic guide Sileus—travel cautiously through an ancient, hyper-vibrant forest in northern Elysia.
-   Beat 2: Reaching a bluff over the River Qi, Sileus halts abruptly, his expression turning to one of intense concentration as he senses a complex, three-part disturbance in the Weave; Miel shivers, feeling a faint, sour note disrupt the river's harmony.
-   Beat 3: Drawn by the sound of battle, the group watches from the bluff as a lone warrior (later revealed to be Tia) fights desperately against a swarm of Rotspawn on the opposite riverbank.
-   Beat 4: They witness a terrified man in strange clothes (later revealed to be Leo) stumble into the fight; Sileus recognizes him as the source of the bizarre anomaly—a pocket of absolute stillness—he felt in the Weave.
-   Beat 5: As the warrior is about to be overwhelmed, the man impulsively grabs her hand, causing a silent, greenish pulse of light to erupt from their touch.
-   Beat 6: The riverbank under the warrior and the man collapses, plunging them into the raging river and scattering the confused Rotspawn.
-   Beat 7: Sileus, intellectually electrified, insists this unique convergence of powerful Resonance, expected Dissonance, and the inexplicable Anomaly is a world-altering sign they must investigate, abandoning their trek to Eleium.
-   Beat 8: Arana argues fiercely against the detour, demanding they stick to their practical, safe plan of reaching the fortified city.
-   Beat 9: Miel and Kaa side with Sileus, creating a majority that convinces Arana to reluctantly agree, but only on the condition that they retreat at the first sign of extreme danger.
-   Beat 10: The Company changes course and follows the river downstream for hours, moving in tense silence as dusk falls over the forest.
-   Beat 11: In the near-darkness, Kaa, scouting from a rocky outcrop, freezes and silently raises a hand, signaling for the others to halt and join him.
-   Beat 12: The group gathers beside Kaa, who points to a small, moonlit sandbank downstream where two dark, motionless figures lie washed ashore at the water's edge.
