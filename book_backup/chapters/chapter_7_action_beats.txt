ACTION_BEATS:

-   Beat 1: The group arrives at the foot of the mountains and gets their first full view of Eleium, a massive and imposing city carved into the stone, representing a bastion of safety and hope.
-   Beat 2: They enter the city's main gates. The initial feeling of relief is immediately challenged by the scene within.
-   Beat 3: The group witnesses that the city is tense and dangerously overcrowded, with the main squares and side streets filled with makeshift camps for desperate refugees fleeing the south.
-   Beat 4: The contrast between the city's grand architecture and the suffering of the refugees creates a souring, trapped atmosphere, dampening their initial relief.
-   Beat 5: Sileus leads the group through the packed streets, navigating towards the administrative or central district where records might be kept.
-   Beat 6: Tia, ignoring the crowds and the squalor, scans every face, her expression a mask of febrile hope as she searches for her mother's contact, her last true ally.
-   Beat 7: They arrive at a records hall or an elder's office, the place Tia was told to seek out.
-   Beat 8: Tia, with Sileus's help, makes the inquiry, giving the name of the family friend her mother spoke of, an old woman named Elara.
-   Beat 9: The keeper of the records or the elder checks their logs and delivers the crushing news.
-   Beat 10: The contact is a dead end. The person is gone, having left years ago.
-   Beat 11: The hope that has sustained Tia throughout her entire journey visibly drains from her face, her shoulders slumping in defeat.
-   Beat 12: The chapter ends on an emotional cliffhanger, focused on Tia's face, now a portrait of bottomless despair as she realizes her mission has failed and she is utterly alone.
