ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: The group travels for days through the contested Midlands, a desolate, gray landscape of struggling farms and watchful, wary travelers, the mood of the company tense and somber after their decision to go south.
- Beat 2: They arrive at the city of Raum, a desperate, heavily fortified outpost perched on a windswept plateau, its walls scarred and its gates heavily guarded.
- Beat 3: The company enters Raum, finding a city choked with fear. The streets are a chaotic mix of grim-faced soldiers, suspicious locals, and refugees who have fled the horrors of the south.
- Beat 4: Ignoring the hostile stares, the group navigates through the crowded streets with a single purpose: to reach the city's southern wall.
- Beat 5: They finally reach the southern wall, a crumbling, neglected battlement that offers a stark contrast to the heavily fortified northern gates.
- Beat 6: The group climbs the worn stone steps and stands on the precipice, looking out over the lands to the south.
- Beat 7: From the wall, they get their first overwhelming look at the Weeping Swamp. It is not just a swamp but a vast, monstrous sea of mist and skeletal trees, stretching to the horizon under a sickly, gray sky.
- Beat 8: The sight is terrifying. Leo is struck with a sense of utter dread, Miel recoils in horror, while Arana's face sets into a mask of grim practicality, and Sileus stares with cold resolve.
- Beat 9: Descending from the wall, they move through Raum's depleted markets, gathering what meager supplies they can findâ€”hard rations, clean water, and a few precious vials of anti-toxins from a grim-faced herbalist.
- Beat 10: The group spends a final, tense night in a squalid corner of an overcrowded barracks, the time filled not with rest, but with the quiet, personal ritual of mental preparation: sharpening blades, checking gear, and steeling themselves for the crossing.
- Beat 11: At dawn, they stand before the southern gate of Raum. They share a silent, final look, a moment that solidifies their reluctant, grim purpose, understanding there is no turning back.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends as the gate groans open and the company steps out of the relative safety of Raum, taking their first steps into the desolate lands that serve as the terrifying border to the Weeping Swamp.
