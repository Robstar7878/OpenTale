ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: Leo awakens from unconsciousness not to a noise, but to a profound, pressing silence. His head throbs, and the room is filled with a chaotic scene of violence and the sharp smell of ozone and blood.
- Beat 2: As his vision clears, Leo sees the aftermath. One thief, the larger of the two, lies slumped against a wall, completely catatonic, his eyes wide and staring into nothing.
- Beat 3: The second thief is coiled on the floor, alive but mentally shattered, clawing at his own eyes and whimpering as if tormented by visions only he can see.
- Beat 4: A shaken Tia is at Leo's side, explaining that the thieves went straight for him. She confirms they took the coin.
- Beat 5: Tia describes the moment the thief seized the coin: it erupted in a silent, colorless, concussive wave of energy that wasn't physical, but slammed directly into the minds of the two attackers.
- Beat 6: Arana and Kaa have secured the room, with Arana holding a blade to the throat of the catatonic thief while Kaa guards the door, their efficiency highlighting the gravity of the situation.
- Beat 7: Sileus steps forward, his expression one of grim fascination. He ignores the thieves and picks up the coin from where it fell, observing its faint, pearlescent glow.
- Beat 8: Holding the faintly glowing artifact, Sileus declares that his theory about the coin was incomplete and that it is a powerful "Weave Meter."
- Beat 9: Sileus explains that the coin didn't release an attack, but rather the raw, unfiltered *difference* in potential energy between two opposing forces.
- Beat 10: He clarifies that the blast was the volatile difference between the pure Resonance emanating from Tia and the corrupting Dissonance infecting the thieves, an energy their minds couldn't withstand.
- Beat 11: Sileus's expression turns from academic fascination to one of dire urgency as he explains the catastrophic consequence of the event.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends on a cliffhanger as Sileus delivers his grim declaration: "That energy wave has acted like a signal flare, revealing our precise location to Asakael. We have to flee the city. *Now*."
