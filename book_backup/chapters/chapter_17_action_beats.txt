ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: The chapter opens at the exact moment from the previous cliffhanger, with Arana letting out a raw, agonized scream that is not a battle cry, but the raw, animal sound of a heart breaking.
- Beat 2: Her friends cry out her name in confusion, their calls lost in the din of combat, but Arana ignores them completely, her focus absolute and her face a mask of anguish.
- Beat 3: She staggers away from her defensive post, abandoning her duty, and her eyes lock onto a heavy, fallen capital stone from another ruined column.
- Beat 4: With a desperate heave that makes the muscles in her back and arms scream in protest, Arana manages to lift the massive heavy stone.
- Beat 5: Ignoring the confused and horrified shouts of her friends, Arana stumbles under the immense weight, turning her attention toward the flawed obsidian pillar she had sworn to defend.
- Beat 6: She takes two more staggering steps, positioning herself directly in front of the pillar's deep, milky-white fracture.
- Beat 7: With a final, soul-shattering cry, Arana swings the massive stone with all of her remaining might.
- Beat 8: The capital stone smashes directly into the weak point of the obsidian pillar.
- Beat 9: A horrifying, high-pitched *crack* echoes through the vault, a sound like a giant pane of glass shattering under immense pressure.
- Beat 10: The fractured pillar does not just crumble; it explodes outwards in a blinding flash of white light as the stored ritual energy from the coin detonates.
- Beat 11: The initial explosion is immediately followed by a devastating implosion as the entire vault gives way, pulling inwards on itself.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends on a catastrophic cliffhanger as the implosion unleashes a devastating shockwave of concussive force and a deadly storm of razor-sharp obsidian shrapnel that tears through the chamber.
