ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: In the quiet aftermath of the Rot-Knight battle, the group tends to their wounds. Sileus approaches a visibly shaken and withdrawn Tia.
- Beat 2: In a low, trembling voice, Tia confides in Sileus. She describes her terrifying temporal vision in detail, revealing it's not the first, but one of several recurring and increasingly dangerous episodes.
- Beat 3: Listening intently, Sileus internally connects Tia's dangerous visions to the paradoxical carving of the coin he found in the secret chamber, his expression hardening with the secret, terrible realization of the true danger she is in.
- Beat 4: Sileus gathers the rest of the group and, with a new and grave authority, declares their plan must change immediately.
- Beat 5: He insists they can no longer run north towards safety; instead, they must turn and travel south, into the heart of the corrupted lands, to confront the source of the paradox head-on.
- Beat 6: Arana reacts with furious disbelief, stepping forward to passionately and logically argue against what she sees as a suicide mission.
- Beat 7: Her fear palpable, Arana pleads with the group, insisting, "Everything we need to survive is north!" Her sound logic and raw emotion create a deep rift in the company's resolve.
- Beat 8: Sileus, unable to reveal the full truth without destroying their hope, remains adamant. He counters Arana's logic with unshakeable conviction, framing the journey south as the only way to understand the mystery of the coin and save Tia's life.
- Beat 9: A tense, heavy silence falls over the group as they are torn between Arana's logic and Sileus's desperate urgency.
- Beat 10: Tia, trusting Sileus's focus on her well-being and fearing the escalating visions more than the physical dangers of the south, makes the final decision and agrees with his plan.
- Beat 11: Arana, defeated by Tia's choice but unwilling to abandon her sister or the group, reluctantly concedes with a look of grim resignation.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends with the divided but unified company turning away from the northern path, their new, grim destination now the ruined city of Ull, deep within the shadows of the south.
