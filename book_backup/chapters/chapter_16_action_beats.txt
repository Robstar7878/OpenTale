ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: As the ritual's energy peaks, the ambush is sprung. Hulking Rot-Knights and their chittering minions erupt from the shadowed archways of the vault, their attack perfectly timed to the ritual's climax.
- Beat 2: The battle explodes into chaos. The clash of steel echoes as Tia's swords meet a Rot-Knight's blade, and Arana's arrows fly with deadly precision from her defensive post at the fractured pillar.
- Beat 3: Arana's tactical plan proves brutally effective; the narrow chokepoints she designed funnel the enemy, allowing the outnumbered company to hold their ground against the onslaught, though the effort is immense.
- Beat 4: The fight becomes a desperate, bloody grind. The company is battered and bruised, their movements growing heavy with exhaustion, but they continue to fight with grim determination, refusing to give an inch.
- Beat 5: Miel works feverishly behind the front line, her face pale with strain, using her herbs to quickly treat a gash on Kaa's arm and keep the fighters on their feet.
- Beat 6: Leo, positioned near Sileus and the pulsating coin, uses a fallen shield to deflect a stray blow meant for Miel, his terror mixed with a newfound, desperate resolve not to be useless.
- Beat 7: Against all odds, the tide begins to turn. The number of attacking minions thins, and Tia and Kaa, working in tandem, manage to bring down one of the hulking Rot-Knights.
- Beat 8: A fragile, desperate hope fills the air. The sounds of battle lessen, and for the first time, the exhausted survivors exchange looks of grim disbeliefâ€”they might actually survive this.
- Beat 9: At the precise peak of their hope, Tia calls out a triumphant "We're doing it!" At that sound, Arana's fierce expression of concentration suddenly shatters.
- Beat 10: Arana's face transforms, her features contorting not with battle-fury, but with a look of pure, soul-crushing anguish, as if she's witnessing an unspeakable personal tragedy.
- Beat 11: She ignores a nearby enemy, her focus completely broken. Her wild, anguished eyes dart away from the fight and lock onto the flawed obsidian pillar she had sworn to protect.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends on this inexplicable character shift, with Arana staring at the pillar, her face a mask of agony, leaving her comrades and the reader to wonder what has just broken inside their staunchest protector.
