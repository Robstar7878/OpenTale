ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: The chapter opens days after the betrayal. The four broken survivors are hiding in a damp, miserable, half-flooded ruin somewhere deep within the Weeping Swamp, the air thick with the smell of mold and stagnant water.
- Beat 2: Miel is physically and emotionally shattered. She sits huddled in a corner, her arm crudely bandaged, staring blankly at the wall, completely numb and unresponsive to the world, lost in her grief.
- Beat 3: Sileus is barely conscious, drifting in and out of a feverish delirium from his wounds. He mutters incomprehensible fragments of lore and prophecy, his guidance silenced.
- Beat 4: Tia remains unresponsive, a living statue. Her eyes are open but vacant, seeing nothing, her consciousness still lost and fragmented in the temporal echoes caused by the vault's implosion.
- Beat 5: Kaa is the only one still functional. He moves like a silent specter, reinforcing their hiding spot with loose rubble or keeping a stoic, tireless watch on the oppressive swamp outside.
- Beat 6: Watching the broken state of his companions, Leo is crushed by the absolute futility of their quest. He understands that Arana died for nothing and their only "weapon" led them directly to this ruin.
- Beat 7: Leo pulls the coin from his pocket. It is cold, inert, and heavy. He no longer sees it as a mystery or a key, but as a mocking symbol of his failure and the false hope that doomed them all.
- Beat 8: Overwhelmed by despair, Leo feels the familiar, heavy cloak of apathy from his old world descend upon him. He welcomes the numbness, retreating into a profound, silent despair.
- Beat 9: His posture changes completely. He becomes still and unresponsive, his gaze vacant, mirroring the broken state of the others and the hopeless man he was before Elysia.
- Beat 10: When Kaa silently offers him a share of their last meager rations, Leo does not even look at him, his silence a clear sign that he has completely given up.
- Beat 11: The ruin is enveloped in a "Gray Silence," a hopeless, oppressive atmosphere of defeat where no one speaks and no one moves, trapped and waiting for the end.
- Beat 12: The chapter concludes on this bleak tableau: Leo staring into the gray, weeping mist of the swamp, his face as empty and colorless as the world he tried to escape, having found a despair far deeper than any he had ever known.
