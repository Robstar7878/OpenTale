CHARACTER_PROFILES:

LEO:
- Role: Main Character, Reluctant Hero, Outsider
- Physical Description: Early 20s (approx. 23-24). Normal, slightly lanky build, showing signs of physical labor but not a trained warrior. His posture is often slightly stooped, as if carrying an invisible weight of disappointment and apathy. His face is ordinary but expressive, often marked by weariness. A few days' stubble suggests he's given up a bit. Dark brown hair, a bit too long and unkempt. Brown eyes that can look empty but also glimmer with surprise, fear, or a rare spark of determination. He has no visible scars or injuries at the outset. Wears a cheap, dark grey or navy blue zippered hoodie, worn and a bit thin for the weather, over a dark, plain t-shirt or thin sweater. Standard, worn denim jeans in dark blue or black. Practical but worn sneakers or work boots, muddy and dirty from travel. He always carries a simple, worn coin in his pocket, often fiddling with it.
- Background: Leo comes from a different, "normal" world, though the specifics of his past are vague. He was likely a mundane individual, perhaps struggling with personal failures or a sense of purposelessness, before being inexplicably drawn into Elysia. The trauma of his sudden displacement and the overwhelming nature of Elysia have left him disoriented and fearful. His inherent "resonance" from his world makes him an anomaly in Elysia, and the ancient coin he unknowingly carries further links him to the world's fundamental Weave.
- Personality: Initially apathetic and cynical, easily overwhelmed, and prone to fear. He carries a deep sense of disillusionment from his past and struggles to find meaning. However, beneath the surface, he possesses a fundamental sense of justice and a nascent courage that emerges when others are in danger. He is observant, though he often tries to deny what he sees, and his logical mind struggles to process the irrationality of Elysia. He often finds the hyper-saturated colors of the untainted lands jarring and overwhelming, a stark contrast to the muted tones of his home world.
- Goals/Motivations: Primarily survival and a desperate desire to return to his own world. As the story progresses, his motivations will shift to protecting those he cares about and understanding his role in Elysia's fate, even if he resists it. He seeks to fill the "inner emptiness" he feels, a void that Elysia's vibrant, yet dangerous, reality might just fill.

TIA:
- Role: Main Character, The Chosen One, Bearer of Aegion's Blood
- Physical Description: Late teens (approx. 18-19). Slender and sinewy, with a hidden strength built for endurance. Her movements are agile, and she carries herself with a natural dignity, even when exhausted and covered in mud. Her face is marked by both nobility and hardship, not classically beautiful but striking, with determined, almost hard features, yet an underlying vulnerability. Long, dark, thick hair, often tangled or in a loose braid. Her most prominent feature is her eyes: an indeterminate but intense green, like a deep, dark emerald. They seem to glow faintly from within and visibly sparkle when she is angry, afraid, or focuses her willpower, especially when pushing against the Weave. Wears a worn tunic of coarse homespun in a deep, faded violet, tied at the waist with a simple leather belt. Practical, durable trousers of dark leather or other robust material, tucked into her boots. A simple but practical travel cloak in the same violet as the tunic, but darker and more worn, with a deep hood. High, worn leather boots, sturdy and well-used. Carries a small leather pouch at her belt, which she guards carefully. She carries two short swords on her back, their hilts worn smooth from use.
- Background: Tia has likely grown up in the "normal" lands, perhaps in the Midlands, aware of the encroaching Rot. She has recently lost all of her immediate family and relatives to the spreading Rot, or the dangers it brought, making her an orphan and the last known living member of her bloodline. This profound loss has instilled in her a deep-seated determination to fight against the Rot and protect others. Unbeknownst to her, she carries the ancient lineage of Aegion's Blood, a power dormant within her, which she will only discover and begin to understand during the story, guided by Sileus. Her family may have kept the knowledge of their bloodline a closely guarded secret due to historical persecution, a secret now lost to her.
- Personality: Resilient, determined, and deeply committed to protecting her people. She carries the weight of the spreading Rot, making her serious and often burdened. Despite her outward strength, she is vulnerable and can be overwhelmed by the responsibility she feels. She possesses a strong moral compass and a fierce protective instinct. She is observant of the subtle shifts in the environment, though she doesn't yet fully understand the underlying Weave connection. Her personal losses have instilled in her a fierce resolve.
- Goals/Motivations: To fight the Rot and prevent others from suffering the same losses she has experienced. She is driven by a deep sense of duty and love for her world. Her personal motivations will evolve as she uncovers her true heritage and the immense power she possesses, struggling with the immense responsibility of being the one who can "repair the Weave" and open/close the Gates.

ARANA:
- Role: Supporting Character, Protector, Pragmatist
- Physical Description: Early 20s (approx. 22-23). Thin and sinewy, almost hard. Her body is the result of a life on the run, built for speed and agility. Her posture is always vigilant, ready to react. A hard, angular face. Her expression is often marked by distrust or pragmatic calculation. Dark blonde or light brown hair, often pulled tightly back in a practical ponytail. Dark brown eyes, sharp and observant. They see everything, analyze everything. Wears practical layered clothing in dark, earthy colors (brown, grey, dark green), a mix of leather and worn fabric, designed for silence and blending into shadows. She carries a bow and arrow on her back, and a quiver always at the ready.
- Background: Arana has borne the brunt of life on the edge of the Rot, likely having lost her own family and being forced to survive independently before encountering Miel and Tia. This has hardened her and made her wary of outsiders. She has learned to survive by her wits and her strength, often having to make difficult, morally grey choices to ensure her survival and the safety of those she protects. She would have witnessed the effects of the "metallic air" in the south, reinforcing her belief in physical threats.
- Personality: Tough, cynical, and fiercely protective of her chosen companions, especially Miel and Tia. She is the most pragmatic and distrustful of the group, always assessing threats and looking for the most direct solution. She values survival above all else and can seem cold or harsh, but her actions are driven by a deep loyalty and affection for those she considers her own. She is resourceful and quick-witted. She is highly skeptical of anything that cannot be explained or fought with physical means.
- Goals/Motivations: To keep her chosen companions safe, by any means necessary. She is driven by a need for security and a desire to control their immediate circumstances. She is less concerned with grand destinies and more with daily survival. She believes in action and tangible results.

MIEL:
- Role: Supporting Character, The Vulnerable Heart, Empath, Healer
- Physical Description: Late teens (approx. 16-17). More delicate and vulnerable in appearance than Arana, but with the same underlying agility. Her movements are quiet, almost ghostly. A softer, rounder face than Arana's, but often marked by deep sadness or anxiety. Her hair is the same color as Arana's but often worn loose and a bit unkempt. Light brown eyes, large and expressive. They often reveal the emotions she tries to hide – fear, sorrow, but also a rare warmth. Her clothes are similar to Arana's in color and style, but perhaps a bit more worn, and she often wears a thicker cloak or shawl that she pulls around herself for protection. She carries no weapons, just a leather bag with gathered herbs.
- Background: Miel has experienced the Rot and the refugee crisis from a vulnerable perspective. She has likely been orphaned and found a new family in Arana and Tia. This has left her with emotional scars and a constant sense of unease. She relies heavily on her chosen family for protection and guidance. She has a natural affinity for the flora of Elysia, particularly healing herbs, which she understands through an intuitive, empathetic connection.
- Personality: Sensitive, empathetic, and easily overwhelmed by the harsh realities of Elysia. She is often anxious and fearful, but possesses a quiet strength and a deep capacity for compassion. She is observant and intuitive, picking up on subtle shifts in the Weave or the emotions of others, even if she doesn't fully comprehend them. She longs for peace and safety, often finding solace in the beauty of the untainted lands, which she cherishes. Her empathy extends to the natural world, allowing her to understand the subtle language of plants.
- Goals/Motivations: To find safety and peace for her chosen family. She yearns for a return to normalcy and is driven by a desire to avoid conflict and suffering. She is motivated by her deep connection to the natural world and a desire to heal, both physically and emotionally. Her subtle, perhaps unrecognized, connection to the Weave's resonance makes her sensitive to its corruption, and she feels a pull towards places of strong resonance.

KAA:
- Role: Supporting Character, Mysterious Ally, Tracker/Scout
- Physical Description: Late teens or very early 20s (approx. 19-20). Thin, but with a surprisingly muscular and defined physique, especially in his arms and back – a climber's body. Moves with a restless, almost superhuman agility and balance, able to navigate treacherous terrain with ease. Angular face with high cheekbones. His expression is often blank or unreadable, making him difficult to interpret. His most striking feature is a thick, almost white mane of hair that falls to his shoulders, a strong contrast to the darker colors of the rest of the group. His eyes are very light, almost silver or ice-grey. They are constantly scanning, observing, but rarely reveal emotions. Wears simple, close-fitting clothes that don't hinder movement: a dark, sleeveless leather tunic over a long-sleeved, thin shirt, and dark, durable trousers. Light, soft leather shoes or moccasins that provide good grip, allowing him to traverse the Weeping Swamp's treacherous ground or scale the jagged mountains. Carries almost nothing, save for a rope coiled over his shoulder and a small pouch with climbing gear or food. He carries several knives, hidden around his body.
- Background: Kaa has likely spent much of his life in the corrupted lands, adapting to their harshness. He might be an orphan or someone who lost his family to the Rot, forcing him to develop unique survival skills and a detached perspective. His white hair and silver eyes could be a subtle manifestation of his prolonged exposure to the Weave's dissonance, or a unique physical trait of his lineage, perhaps indicating a subtle, unknown resistance to the Rot's effects. He has learned to navigate the dangers of the Weeping Swamp and the "Metallic Blight" by instinct.
- Personality: Enigmatic, quiet, and highly focused. Kaa seems detached from emotional responses, operating purely on instinct and observation. He is fiercely independent but displays loyalty through his actions rather than words. He has a deep, almost primal understanding of Elysia's corrupted lands, having survived there, and seems uniquely unaffected by the paranoia of the "Metallic Blight." He rarely speaks, preferring to communicate through gestures or direct, concise statements.
- Goals/Motivations: Primarily survival and perhaps a silent, unspoken desire to understand the Rot that shaped him. He may be drawn to Tia's power to heal the Weave, seeing it as a potential solution to the world he inhabits, or perhaps a means to gain some control over the chaos. He seeks purpose, even if he doesn't articulate it, and might be silently driven by a need for stability in the blighted lands.

SILEUS:
- Role: Supporting Character, Mentor, Mystical Guide
- Physical Description: Appears to be in his 40s. Lanky but tough. He possesses an energy and vitality that belies his enigmatic nature. His face is weathered and wrinkled, but with sharp, intelligent features. His eyes are small, keen, and almost bird-like; they miss nothing. His defining garment is a two-sided cloak. One side is sewn from hundreds of small, square fabric pieces in every conceivable, often vibrant, color, resembling a chaotic but beautiful patchwork, a visual explosion – his "public" side, designed to reflect the vibrant beauty of the untainted lands. The other side is sewn from similar squares but in muted earth tones – dark brown, moss green, grey, ocher – functioning as effective camouflage in forests and shadows, allowing him to blend into nature. He can flip the cloak with a quick, fluid motion to switch "modes." He wears a large, wide-brimmed hat of constant grey-brown felt, neutral enough to match both sides of the cloak. In the hatband, he has tucked some dried flowers and leaves in muted greens and browns, echoing the camouflage side. The hat cannot be reversed. Practical, worn, but quiet dark leather shoes. Carries a worn walking stick of twisted wood, which he uses more for pointing and gesturing than for support, almost as an extension of his body. His hands are calloused and strong, revealing a life of travel and practical engagement with the world. Has many hidden pockets in his cloak, often producing seemingly random but useful items.
- Background: Sileus is a solitary wanderer who has dedicated his life to studying the Weave and its balance, meticulously gathering knowledge from forgotten texts and observing the world's subtle shifts. He has likely traveled extensively throughout Elysia, observing the effects of both resonance and dissonance, including the spread of the Rot from the Southern Valleys. He has been waiting for the arrival of someone who could bear Aegion's Blood, or perhaps for a catalyst like Leo, to set events in motion. His knowledge of Aegion's Blood's true nature and origin is unparalleled.
- Personality: Eccentric, wise, and highly perceptive. Sileus is a scholar of the Weave, possessing ancient knowledge that seems almost magical to others. He often speaks in riddles or metaphors, but his guidance is invaluable. He has a dry wit and a deep understanding of human nature, as well as the cosmic forces at play in Elysia. He is patient but firm, pushing others to understand rather than simply follow. He finds the "Day of Colors" a deeply meaningful celebration, a testament to the Weave's resilience.
- Goals/Motivations: To restore balance to Elysia and prevent Asakael from completely tearing the Weave apart. He is driven by a profound respect for the natural order and a sense of responsibility to guide those who can make a difference. He seeks to impart his knowledge to Tia and Leo, preparing them for the monumental task ahead, and to protect the Weave Pits from corruption.

ASAKAEL:
- Role: Main Antagonist, Cosmic Force of Corruption
- Physical Description: His form is not consistently corporeal. He most often manifests as a concentration of pure shadow, a deeper black spot in the darkness that defined the room, absorbing all light. Within this void, two malevolent, burning orange embers serve as his eyes, glowing with cold, destructive energy. His voice is a dry, rasping sound, like sand and glass scraping together, a sound that seems to echo from within the very fabric of dissonance. He is a presence of profound cold and Dissonance, causing physical discomfort, paranoia, and withdrawal in those exposed to him. When he manifests physically, black, viscous pools might form at his "feet," and the air around him tastes of metallic tang and decay.
- Background: An ancient, primordial force of entropy, the antithesis of Aegion's Blood and the Weave itself. His purpose is to unmake creation by corrupting and ultimately tearing The Weave apart, returning Elysia to a silent, static void. He was active in the world's ancient past, before entering a millennial sleep, during which knowledge of him faded. He has now reawakened and is actively spreading his influence from the Southern Valleys northward.
- Personality: Utterly malevolent, but also highly intelligent, patient, and strategic. He is a master of manipulation, preying on fear and weakness, particularly the sense of hopelessness fostered by the Rot. He feels nothing but contempt for life, harmony, and creation itself, viewing the Weave as an aberration to be undone. He delights in the suffering and despair he inflicts.
- Goals/Motivations: To unleash his full power by manipulating Tia into opening the "Gates" to raw cosmic energy, thereby allowing him to completely destroy The Weave and plunge Elysia into a silent, static void. He seeks ultimate oblivion.

ROTSPAWN (The Green-Browns):
- Role: Minions, Cannon Fodder, Manifestations of The Rot
- Physical Description: They are twisted, grotesque, failed forms of life, once native fauna now hideously warped by Asakael's influence. Green-brown skin, often slick with a sickly sheen, is stretched taut over skeletons that seem to lack joints where they should be, giving them an unnatural, disjointed appearance. They have two lizard-like eyes that glow with a dull, malevolent light, devoid of intelligence. Their arms are too long and crooked, ending in sharp, blackened claws. Their mouths are full of too many, uneven teeth, often dripping with a black, corrosive ichor. They move with a jerky, unnatural gait, sometimes scuttling, sometimes lurching, and hiss and make hoarse, malicious sounds that grate on the ears. Their bodies often bear signs of the Metallic Blight, with patches of metallic-looking scales or growths, or the damp decay of the Weeping Swamp.
- Background: Not a natural species, but rather the result of Elysia's native fauna (e.g., deer, wolves, large insects, even fish) being hideously warped by The Rot in corrupted zones like the Southern Valleys and the Weeping Swamp. They are living extensions of Asakael's corrupting influence, physical manifestations of dissonance. They are most prevalent in the deeply blighted areas, serving as a terrifying natural defense for Asakael's domain.
- Personality: Operating on base, cruel instincts. They are not intelligent strategists but are driven by a simple mandate from their master: to cause pain, to capture, and to destroy. They possess a low, cunning instinct for hunting but are cowardly when faced with powers they don't understand or overwhelming force, retreating into the shadows of the corrupted lands. They are devoid of empathy or self-preservation beyond their immediate directives. Their presence causes deep unease and can induce a sense of hopelessness in those nearby.
- Goals/Motivations: To serve Asakael's immediate will, such as capturing Tia, harassing refugees, or guarding corrupted areas. They are animated by the corrupt Dissonance that created them, and their existence is a testament to Asakael's destructive power.
