ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: The group's tense flight through the Weaver's Paths is shattered as an intelligent, hulking Rot-Knight emerges from the darkness ahead, its presence interrupting their escape.
- Beat 2: The battle begins immediately, the tight, claustrophobic confines of the tunnel turning the fight into a desperate, close-quarters struggle for survival against the powerful creature.
- Beat 3: In the chaos of the melee, Tia's arm brushes against Leo's, her hand making contact with the part of his pocket where the coin rests.
- Beat 4: The touch triggers a powerful reaction. Tia is struck by a disorienting temporal vision, her eyes widening in shock as her mind is flooded with horrifying, disjointed images.
- Beat 5: Staggered and disoriented by the vision, Tia falters, her defense dropping completely, leaving her vulnerable and exposed.
- Beat 6: The intelligent Rot-Knight senses her weakness instantly and raises its massive weapon, preparing to deliver a killing blow to the incapacitated Tia.
- Beat 7: With his preternatural senses and agility, Kaa sees the imminent danger.
- Beat 8: In a blur of motion, Kaa launches himself across the tunnel at the last possible second, tackling Tia and knocking her out of the path of the Rot-Knight's deadly, descending blow.
- Beat 9: Kaa's intervention saves Tia's life and creates a momentary opening for the rest of the group.
- Beat 10: The company rallies, focusing their attacks on the momentarily off-balance Rot-Knight, and with a final, unified effort, they manage to strike it down.
- Beat 11: As the Rot-Knight collapses into a pile of dust and armor, a heavy silence falls over the tunnel, the immediate physical threat now gone.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends on a cliffhanger as Tia, safe from the Knight but overwhelmed by what she saw, suddenly collapses to her knees, her breathing ragged and her eyes wide with the unspeakable terror of the vision she just experienced.
