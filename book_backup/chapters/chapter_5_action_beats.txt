ACTION_BEATS:

-   Beat 1: Around a tense campfire, Leo breaks the silence, questioning Tia about why the monstrous creatures (the Rotspawn) specifically targeted her.
-   Beat 2: Sileus seizes the moment to deliver a major revelation, explaining the ancient legend of Aegion's Bloodâ€”a bloodline with the power to heal the world's life-force (the Weave) or, in the wrong hands, give the evil entity Asakael the power to rewrite reality into eternal torment.
-   Beat 3: Sileus concludes his story by identifying a stunned and horrified Tia as the last living bearer of Aegion's Blood, the key Asakael is hunting.
-   Beat 4: Arana furiously dismisses the legend as a dangerous fairy tale, arguing that focusing on such myths will get them all killed and that their only focus should be practical survival.
-   Beat 5: Arana's pragmatic and logical argument resonates deeply with Leo's own skepticism, and he finds himself siding with her against Sileus's mysticism.
-   Beat 6: Crushed by the weight of this unwanted destiny and the guilt that her heritage might be the cause of her family's death, Tia flees the fireside and is quietly followed and comforted by Miel.
-   Beat 7: The group reconvenes, where Arana establishes herself as the tactical leader, laying down strict, practical rules for their journey north to Eleium, forming a fragile company pact.
-   Beat 8: The next morning, the newly formed company begins their journey north, following Arana's strict formation with Kaa scouting ahead.
-   Beat 9: During the march, the group discovers a patch of magically glowing flowers, the Weavehearts, that Miel explains grow only where the Weave is pure.
-   Beat 10: In the flowers' presence, the coin in Leo's pocket begins to vibrate with a warm energy. Leo and Tia share a moment of shocked recognition, as Tia is the only other person who perceives the coin's reaction.
-   Beat 11: While Sileus smiles knowingly, Arana dismisses the magical flowers as useless because they can't be eaten, reinforcing her pragmatic worldview and urgency to keep moving.
-   Beat 12: Hours later, the forest falls into an unnatural, absolute silence. Kaa freezes mid-step, his eyes locked on an unseen threat in the shadows. Arana instantly draws an arrow, and the entire company realizes they are being stalked by a large predator.
