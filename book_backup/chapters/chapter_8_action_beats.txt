ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: The group finds lodging in a crowded, noisy inn called "The Hungry Boar," the atmosphere thick with the smells of food and the sound of dozens of conversations.
- Beat 2: Sitting at a table amidst the chaos, Leo nervously handles the strange coin from his world, the familiar weight a small comfort as he tries to process the overwhelming reality of Eleium.
- Beat 3: Across the common room, two shadowy thieves take notice of Leo's fidgeting, their greedy eyes locking onto the glint of the unique, unadorned coin.
- Beat 4: Later, in one of the cramped rooms the group has secured, the mood is tense and unsettled following Tia's devastating news.
- Beat 5: Lost in thought, Leo accidentally drops the coin, which clatters onto the rough wooden floorboards.
- Beat 6: As the coin lands and begins to spin, time seems to warp for a moment; the ambient noise of the inn fades into a low hum, and the coin's rotation appears unnaturally slow and stretched.
- Beat 7: Leo's head snaps up, and he locks eyes with Tia from across the room, her wide, confused expression confirming she was the only other person to perceive the temporal distortion, leaving them both unsettled.
- Beat 8: Late that night, the members of the company are asleep in their respective beds, the room dark and quiet.
- Beat 9: The door to the room creaks open, and the two thieves from the common room slip inside, their movements silent and predatory in the darkness.
- Beat 10: The thieves ignore the more formidable-looking members of the company, moving directly and purposefully towards the sleeping Leo.
- Beat 11: One of the thieves lunges, his arm raised to strike the unsuspecting Leo.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends abruptly as a fist connects with Leo's head, and he is knocked violently and instantly unconscious.
