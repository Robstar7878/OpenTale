**CHARACTER\_PROFILES:**

**LEO:**

-   **Role:** Main Character, Reluctant Hero, The Temporal Anchor
-   **Physical Description:** Early 20s. A normal, slightly lanky build from manual labor at a carpet warehouse. His posture is often slightly stooped, as if carrying the invisible weight of disappointment. A few days' stubble suggests he's given up a bit. Dark brown, unkempt hair. Brown eyes that often look empty but can glimmer with fear or a rare spark of determination. Wears mundane clothes from his world—a cheap, dark grey zippered hoodie, worn denim jeans, and practical but worn work boots—all quickly becoming muddy and travel-worn. He always carries a strange, faded coin in his pocket—etched with the faint image of two serpents chasing each other's tails—and often fiddles with it as a nervous habit.
-   **Background:** Comes from our "normal" world, where he was drowning in quiet despair. His life consisted of a soul-crushing job at a carpet warehouse and reeling from the searing humiliation of his breakup with his ex, Cecilia, who left him for his smarmy boss, Paul. Trudging home through the rain, he apathetically picks up a strange coin from a gutter, and reality dissolves. His very nature—grounded in a non-magical, linear reality—makes him a "silence" in the magical Weave of Elysia, an unpredictable anomaly in a world of destiny and magic.
-   **Personality:** Initially apathetic, cynical, and easily overwhelmed by the sensory and emotional intensity of Elysia. His logical, mundane mind struggles to process the irrationality of magic, monsters, and paradoxes. Beneath this cynical surface, however, is a fundamental decency and a nascent courage that emerges impulsively when others are in danger. His journey is a constant battle against his own despair and the instinct to retreat into the apathy that defined his old life. He is observant but often tries to deny what he sees, especially the strange temporal flickers and visions that seem to plague Tia when he is near.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** Initially, his only goal is survival and a desperate desire to return to the mundane safety of his own world. This quickly shifts to a fierce, protective instinct for his new companions, particularly Tia. His ultimate motivation becomes embracing his outsider status not as a weakness, but as a unique strength. He must become the Temporal Anchor, consciously using his connection to a simple, absolute, non-magical reality—the memory of rain on his face—to impose the concept of "NOW" onto the temporal storm of Tia's power, saving her and weaponizing the very paradox that threatens to unmake her.

**TIA:**

-   **Role:** Main Character, Bearer of Aegion's Blood, The Paradox's Catalyst
-   **Physical Description:** Late teens (approx. 18-19). Slender and sinewy, with an agile strength built for endurance rather than brute force. Her face is striking, marked by both hardship and a deep-seated determination. Long, dark, thick hair, often kept in a loose, practical braid. Her most prominent feature is her intense green eyes, which seem to hold a faint inner light (Resonance). She wears a worn tunic of faded violet, durable trousers, and sturdy leather boots. Carries two short swords on her back, their hilts worn smooth from years of use.
-   **Background:** The last known living member of her bloodline, which secretly carries Aegion's Blood. Following her mother's dying wish, her sole mission was to travel north to the city of Eleium and find a specific family friend, her only potential ally in the world. She is unaware of the full, terrifying scope of her heritage—that her blood makes her a living conduit for the Weave, and her personal timeline is dangerously unstable when near the paradoxical coin Leo carries.
-   **Personality:** Resilient, determined, and burdened by a sense of responsibility for the fallen world around her. Despite her outward strength, she is vulnerable to the strange, disorienting temporal visions and moments of intense vertigo that plague her whenever she touches Leo or is near the coin. She is pragmatic but, unlike Arana's cynical logic, is willing to believe in the desperate hope Sileus offers. She forms a quick, deep, and protective bond with Leo, unconsciously drawn to the quiet stability he represents.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** Her initial, personal goal is to fulfill her mother's wish and find her contact in Eleium. After that hope dies, her goal evolves into understanding her heritage and the terrifying power Sileus describes. Ultimately, she must confront the reality that her only path to victory is to make a choice of ultimate sacrifice: to deliberately trigger the **Annihilation by Totality**, shredding her own consciousness across her timeline to generate the power needed to unmake Asakael, trusting Leo completely to be the anchor that can pull her back from oblivion.

**ARANA:**

-   **Role:** Supporting Character, The Pragmatist, The Protector, **The Traitor**
-   **Physical Description:** Early 20s (approx. 22-23). A hard, sinewy build designed for speed and agility. Her posture is always vigilant, her body a coiled spring. She has a hard, angular face with sharp, observant dark brown eyes that see and analyze everything. Dark blonde hair is often pulled tightly and efficiently back. Wears practical layered clothing in earthy colors and carries a bow and quiver, always ready for a threat.
-   **Background:** Her hardened exterior is a masterful deception. Her family is not lost; her younger brother (Miel's sibling) is alive, held captive and perpetually tortured by Asakael. This provides the unbreakable leverage that has forced her to become Asakael's agent. Her insidious, long-term mission is to infiltrate any group that forms around Tia, earn their complete trust by playing the role of the hyper-vigilant protector, and secretly guide them toward their ultimate ruin.
-   **Personality:** Her public persona is that of a tough, cynical, and fiercely protective pragmatist. She is the voice of cold, hard logic, always assessing threats and advocating for the "safest" course of action (which conveniently aligns with Asakael's plans). Her arguments against Sileus's mystical guidance seem entirely reasonable, earning her the trust of the group. Internally, she is in a state of constant, soul-crushing anguish, torn between her desperate love for her brother and the genuine affection she develops for the companions she is sworn to betray.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** Her overt goal is to keep her companions safe by any means necessary. Her true, all-consuming motivation is to save her brother, no matter the cost to the world or the people she has come to care for. This culminates in her desperate act in the vault at Ull, where she deliberately shatters the obsidian pillar she had sworn to protect, triggering the catastrophic collapse. Her final, mortal act is a raw, agonized attempt at redemption as she confesses the truth to Miel while throwing herself in the way of an attack meant for her sister.

**MIEL:**

-   **Role:** Supporting Character, The Healer, The Empathic Heart, **Arana's Sister**
-   **Physical Description:** Late teens (approx. 16-17). More delicate in appearance than her sister, her movements quiet and almost ghostly. She has a softer, rounder face, often marked by anxiety. Her light brown eyes are large and expressive, revealing her fear and sorrow, but also a rare warmth. She carries a leather satchel filled with gathered herbs, poultices, and bandages.
-   **Background:** Arana's younger sister. She has been led to believe that their brother is dead, a casualty of the spreading Rot. She has a natural, empathetic connection to the flora of Elysia and can sense the "sickness" of Dissonance in the land, which makes her a gifted, if intuitive, healer. She looks up to Arana's strength, seeing it as a shield against the world's horrors.
-   **Personality:** Sensitive, deeply empathetic, and easily overwhelmed by the world's suffering. She is often anxious but possesses a quiet strength and profound compassion that makes her the group's moral compass. She is the first to offer comfort and the one who tends to everyone's wounds, both physical and emotional.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** To find safety and peace for her found family, and especially to stay with her fiercely protective older sister, Arana, whom she adores. Her entire worldview is shattered by Arana's dying confession. This horrific revelation—that her sister's actions were born of a tormented love—fuels her with a new, hardened resolve to make that terrible sacrifice mean something by seeing the fight against Asakael through to the end.

**KAA:**

-   **Role:** Supporting Character, The Silent Scout
-   **Physical Description:** Late teens or very early 20s (approx. 19-20). A lean, muscular climber's body that moves with a restless, almost superhuman agility. His angular face is often unreadable, a mask of hyper-focus. His most striking feature is a thick mane of almost white hair, contrasting with his dark, practical clothing. His light, ice-grey eyes are constantly scanning, noticing details others miss. He carries several knives, hidden and readily accessible.
-   **Background:** Having spent much of his life surviving alone in the contested and corrupted lands, he has a primal understanding of its dangers. He is not merely quiet; his silence is a deeply ingrained survival tool learned from years of hunting and being hunted.
-   **Personality:** Enigmatic, instinctual, and hyper-focused. He operates on observation and action, not words. His loyalty is shown by appearing at the last possible second to save someone from a threat he spotted moments before anyone else. He is fiercely independent but recognizes the strength of the company.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** Primarily survival. He is drawn to the group because he instinctively recognizes that their combined strength and purpose offer a better chance of navigating the increasing chaos than going it alone. He holds a silent, unspoken desire to see the world healed, as he knows the pain of the corrupted lands more intimately than anyone.

**SILEUS:**

-   **Role:** Supporting Character, Mentor, The Burdened Scholar
-   **Physical Description:** Appears to be in his 40s, lanky but tough. His face is weathered, with sharp, intelligent features and keen, bird-like eyes that miss nothing. His defining garment is a practical, two-sided cloak: one side a vibrant, chaotic patchwork of colors for festivals or distraction; the other muted earth tones for camouflage. He carries a twisted walking stick more for gesturing than support.
-   **Background:** A solitary wanderer who has dedicated his life to studying The Weave and its forgotten history from obscure texts. He initially believes Leo's coin is a "Weave Meter," a simple artifact for measuring Resonance and Dissonance. His entire understanding is shattered when he discovers the ancient Ouroboros carving in the Weaver's Paths, realizing with dawning horror that the coin is not a tool but a physical paradox—a temporal bomb.
-   **Personality:** Eccentric, wise, and highly perceptive. He is patient but becomes driven by a grim, new urgency after discovering the coin's true nature. He makes the difficult choice to withhold this terrifying truth from the already fragile group, carrying the heavy burden of knowing that their only hope is a cataclysmic power that could erase Tia from existence. This secret knowledge hardens his resolve and explains why he insists they must stop running north and instead go south to confront the source of the corruption head-on.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** To restore balance to Elysia. After discovering the paradox, his goal shifts to desperately trying to understand and manage it. He must guide the group toward a direct confrontation where this terrifying, uncontrollable power might be their only, and most costly, option for victory.

**ASAKAEL:**

-   **Role:** Main Antagonist, Cosmic Force of Corruption, The Master Manipulator
-   **Physical Description:** Most often manifests as a concentration of pure shadow or a profound psychic pressure. When he chooses to show a form, it is a flowing darkness with two malevolent, burning embers for eyes. His voice is a dry, rasping sound that echoes directly in the mind. His presence exudes a profound cold and Dissonance that causes physical pain and mental distress. His lair is a literal crater of non-existence, a wound in reality.
-   **Background:** An ancient, primordial force of entropy whose purpose is to unmake creation by tearing The Weave apart. Having recently reawakened from a millennial sleep, he is spreading his influence from the Southern Valleys northward, enjoying the slow decay of the world.
-   **Personality:** Utterly malevolent, but also highly intelligent, patient, and strategic. He is a master of psychological manipulation who delights in despair, finding more satisfaction in breaking a hero's spirit than their body. He engineers Arana's betrayal with detached, cruel precision, viewing her love for her brother as a simple, effective tool.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** To capture Tia and corrupt her Aegion's Blood, using its power to rewrite the very fabric of reality into a realm of eternal, conscious torment. He is confident in his victory and views the heroes' struggle—especially the unforeseen "variable" of the Temporal Anchor—with amused, academic curiosity.

**ROTSPAWN:**

-   **Role:** Minions, Cannon Fodder
-   **Physical Description:** Hideously warped beings created from corrupted earth, wood, and bone. They often take the form of twisted native fauna (deer, insects), with green-brown skin stretched over disjointed skeletons, crooked limbs, blackened claws, and mouths full of uneven teeth dripping black ichor. Their eyes glow with a dull, malevolent light devoid of true intelligence. They move with a jerky, unnatural gait.
-   **Personality:** Operating on cruel, base instincts. They are driven by a simple mandate from their master to cause pain, spread corruption, and attack the living. They possess a low, cunning instinct for hunting in packs but are cowardly when faced with overwhelming or unexpected force.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** To serve Asakael's immediate will: capture high-value targets like Tia, harass travelers, and guard corrupted areas. They are the most common physical manifestation of the Rot.

**DARK WOLF:**

-   **Role:** Elite Hunter, Corrupted Predator
-   **Physical Description:** A larger, more intelligent version of a corrupted wolf. Its fur is the color of charcoal and shadow, seeming to drink the light. Its eyes glow with a malevolent, cunning intelligence, unlike the dull light of the Rotspawn. Its movements are fluid and predatory, not jerky. Its claws and teeth are unnaturally long and stained with the black ichor of the Rot, and its howl is a Dissonant sound that causes fear and disorientation.
-   **Background:** Where Rotspawn are twisted victims, Dark Wolves are apex predators that have not just been corrupted by the Rot but have *embraced* it, forming a symbiotic bond with the Dissonance. They retain their hunting instincts and intelligence, which are then amplified by Asakael's influence, making them far more dangerous than a standard Rotspawn.
-   **Personality:** Cunning, patient, and viciously intelligent. A Dark Wolf will stalk its prey, learn its weaknesses, and strike with tactical precision, often using the terrain to its advantage. It is not just a monster; it is a sentient hunter fueled by malice.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** To hunt and kill for its master, Asakael. They often act as alpha predators among lesser Rotspawn, leading them in coordinated ambushes. Their primary motivation is the thrill of a successful hunt and the spreading of fear.

**ROT-KNIGHT:**

-   **Role:** Elite Minion, Commander of the Rot
-   **Physical Description:** A tall, humanoid figure clad in jagged, overlapping plates of armor that seem forged from solidified shadow and nightmare. The armor is a black, corroded mockery of noble plate, its surface crawling with faint, pulsing runes of Dissonance that glow with a sickening, internal light, like dying embers. Barbs of obsidian-like material jut out at sharp, unnatural angles. It wields a massive, chipped greatsword, so black it seems to absorb the light, its edge weeping a black, viscous substance that sizzles as it drips. Its movements are heavy and implacable, yet possess a terrifying, unnatural swiftness. Its face is hidden behind a featureless, sealed helm, but where the eye slits should be, there is only a void—an absolute, dizzying emptiness.
-   **Background:** The origin of the Rot-Knights is a dark mystery. Some whisper they are the animated husks of the greatest warriors who fell fighting Asakael, their armor and will now enslaved, their souls devoured. Others believe they are constructs of pure Dissonance given form and purpose by their master. They serve as Asakael's lieutenants in the field, instruments of his strategic will.
-   **Personality:** Cold, utterly silent, and implacably single-minded. A Rot-Knight exhibits a chilling tactical intelligence, able to command packs of lesser Rotspawn, exploit terrain, and target the hope and leadership within a group with terrifying precision. It does not feel pain or fear, only the cold, empty imperative of its master's will. It is a relentless, intelligent killing machine.
-   **Goals/Motivations:** To execute Asakael's strategic commands with brutal efficiency. They act as field commanders, siege-breakers, and hunters of high-value targets like Tia. Their presence on the battlefield is a guarantee of a coordinated, intelligent, and utterly merciless assault.
