ACTION\_BEATS:

-   Beat 1: With grim resolve born from Sileus's warning, the group flees Eleium under the cover of pre-dawn darkness, slipping like ghosts through the city's forgotten back alleys.
-   Beat 2: Sileus leads them to a collapsed ruin at the edge of the city. He approaches a solid section of wall and places his hand on a large, flat stone, his fingers tracing a faint, worn pattern on its surface.
-   Beat 3: He follows the pattern—a spiral folding inward—to a small, deep hole at its center. With a look of concentration, Sileus presses his thumb hard into the indentation.
-   Beat 4: With a series of soft, mechanical clicks from deep within the wall, the stone retracts and slides aside, revealing a dark, rectangular opening into the ancient, subterranean "Weaver's Paths."
-   Beat 5: They descend into the tunnels, which are ancient and smooth, the walls seemingly woven from stone and glowing with a faint, warm internal energy.
-   Beat 6: After hours of walking, the group makes camp. While the others rest, Sileus, feeling a faint but persistent anomaly in the Weave, tells the group he is going to scout ahead alone.
-   Beat 7: Following the strange pull, Sileus discovers a hidden, circular chamber off the main path, its walls covered in ancient, detailed carvings.
-   Beat 8: Sileus's attention is drawn to the chamber's central, most prominent carving: two massive serpents chasing each other's tails in a perfect circle—a symbol of a closed loop.
-   Beat 9: Sileus freezes in horror as he examines the center of the carving. It is not a sun or a star, but the unmistakable, detailed image of Leo's coin.
-   Beat 10: In that instant, Sileus's "Weave Meter" theory is utterly shattered. He is confronted with irrefutable proof that the coin is not just a reactive artifact but a central piece of a temporal paradox.
-   Beat 11: Devastated, he realizes the terrible truth: Tia's power is the fuel for this paradox, and their proximity is a danger that will ultimately unmake her.
-   Beat 12: He returns to the group, his face a mask of calm composure. He lies about what he found, keeping the terrifying secret of the paradox to himself, his expression now hardened with a new, private burden.
