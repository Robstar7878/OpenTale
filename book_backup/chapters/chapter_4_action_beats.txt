ACTION\_BEATS:

-   Beat 1: Battered and exhausted, Leo and Tia wash up on a muddy sandbank of the River Qi, coughing up water and struggling to breathe in the falling dusk.
-   Beat 2: As they recover, Leo impulsively helps Tia sit up, and they exchange names for the first time. A tense, quiet understanding passes between the two survivors.
-   Beat 3: As the cold of the night sets in, Tia hears a sound. She draws her swords as four armed figures—Arana, Miel, Kaa, and Sileus—emerge silently from the dark woods.
-   Beat 4: A tense standoff ensues. Sileus, the group's guide, questions Tia, while the warrior Arana keeps her bow trained on them, her suspicion clear.
-   Beat 5: Sileus de-escalates the confrontation, pointing out the shared danger of the night and offering to make camp together for safety.
-   Beat 6: Tia reluctantly agrees to the truce. The four survivors lead the drenched and shivering Leo and Tia to a sheltered campsite within a cluster of large rocks.
-   Beat 7: The group builds a fire. In a gesture of practical kindness, Arana provides rough, dry blankets while Miel gives them a warm, bitter herbal drink to ward off the cold.
-   Beat 8: Around the campfire, Sileus gently questions them. Leo gives a vague answer about not being from Elysia, while Tia confirms they were attacked by Rotspawn.
-   Beat 9: Pressed by Sileus, Tia reveals her personal mission: she is the last of her people and is traveling to the northern city of Eleium to find a family friend, fulfilling her mother's dying wish.
-   Beat 10: Sileus reveals that their group is also heading to Eleium. Citing the shared goal and the obvious dangers, he formally proposes that they join forces and travel together.
-   Beat 11: Arana remains visibly skeptical of the newcomers, but she does not object to Sileus's practical logic.
-   Beat 12: After a brief, confirming glance at Leo, Tia accepts the offer. A fragile truce is formed as the exhausted new members of the company settle down to sleep, and Kaa takes the first silent watch.
