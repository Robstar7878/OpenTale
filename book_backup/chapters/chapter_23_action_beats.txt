ACTION_BEATS:
- Beat 1: Pushed to her absolute limit, her energy failing against the crushing pressure of negation, Tia locks eyes with Leo and makes the final, desperate choice.
- Beat 2: With a look of grim resolve, Tia reaches out and deliberately places her hand over Leo's, pressing it firmly against the Temporal Anchor coin he holds.
- Beat 3: The moment she touches the coin, Annihilation by Totality begins. Her physical form doesn't just vanish; it fractures into a storm of conflicting possibilities as her entire timeline—past, present, and every potential future—converges on her at once.
- Beat 4: Leo watches in horror, not as Tia disappears, but as she is violently unwritten by the sheer weight of her own potential. She is a child learning to walk, a young woman dying in a swamp, and a wizened elder queen, all in the same terrifying instant. The paradox of her total existence rips her very being from the fabric of reality.
- Beat 5: Spurred by the sight of her being torn apart by possibility, Leo finally and fully embraces his nature. He accepts his identity as the Temporal Anchor.
- Beat 6: He shuts out the cosmic chaos, focuses his entire being on a simple, mundane memory—the feeling of rain on his face on a grey street—and imposes the absolute, linear reality of "NOW" into the storm.
- Beat 7: Like a vortex forming around a stone, the temporal storm of infinite possibilities violently collapses around the single, unshakeable point of stability that is Leo.
- Beat 8: The scattered echoes of Tia's consciousness are pulled from every potential timeline, funneling back into the present and re-forming her physical body around the anchor point of Leo's hand.
- Beat 9: Tia is reborn in that instant, no longer just a warrior, but a living conduit for the focused power of her entire condensed timeline, her eyes burning with the energy of a thousand lifetimes.
- Beat 10: Acting as one, Tia aims the torrential power while Leo grounds it, and together they unleash the full, cataclysmic force as a focused, devastating beam of pure, weaponized time.
- Beat 11: The torrent of time strikes the crater of negation. The anti-reality cannot withstand the force of Tia's entire existence striking it at once. Asakael is not just killed; he is utterly and paradoxically unmade, erased from the timeline he sought to control.
- Beat 12: The chapter ends with a triumphant, cathartic victory as the crushing pressure vanishes instantly, and a wave of pure, clean Resonance washes over the valley, leaving only a profound silence of peace where the tyrant once was.
