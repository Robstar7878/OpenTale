ACTION\_BEATS:

-   Beat 1: Leo, a man consumed by apathy after a humiliating breakup with his ex-girlfriend Cecilia and her new partner, his boss Paul, trudges home from his soul-crushing warehouse job through a bleak, rain-drenched city.
-   Beat 2: Walking down a decaying street, Leo's gaze falls on a pile of overflowing garbage, a small monument to the urban decay that mirrors his internal state.
-   Beat 3: Driven by a sudden, frustrated impulse, Leo kicks the pile of trash, dislodging a dark object that skids across the wet pavement and comes to a stop.
-   Beat 4: Leo pauses and picks up the object: a strange, heavy coin made of a dark metal. He can just make out the worn, faint etching of two serpents chasing each other's tails on its surface.
-   Beat 5: Clutching the coin, Leo feels it grow unnaturally cold as his reality dissolves. The city around him distorts, the rain freezes in mid-air, and the world dissolves into a swirling vortex of green and black that pulls him from his existence.
-   Beat 6: Leo opens his eyes to the northern Midlands of Elysia, a hyper-vibrant world of impossible color and life that is a shocking sensory overload compared to the grey world he left behind.
-   Beat 7: A sharp, human scream of rage and pain cuts through the alien sounds of Elysia, pulling Leo's attention toward a wide, raging river in the distance.
-   Beat 8: Leo sees a lone, fierce warrior (later revealed to be Tia) with two short swords fighting for her life. She is surrounded by a swarm of grotesque, twisted creatures (later revealed to be Rotspawn) that look like they are made of mud and rotting leaves.
-   Beat 9: Though the warrior fights with brutal efficiency, she is clearly outnumbered and exhausted. She dodges a vicious attack from a larger creature but stumbles on the slick riverbank, falling and leaving herself vulnerable.
-   Beat 10: The sight of her imminent doom shatters Leo's apathy. Without thinking, he acts on a sudden, selfless impulse and sprints across the alien landscape toward the desperate fight.
-   Beat 11: Leo reaches the chaotic scene just as the monstrous creatures close in on the fallen warrior. He lunges forward, past the monsters, and grabs the warrior's outstretched hand.
-   Beat 12: The moment their hands touch, the unstable riverbank gives way beneath them with a sickening lurch, plunging both Leo and the warrior into the raging, icy torrent of the River Qi.
